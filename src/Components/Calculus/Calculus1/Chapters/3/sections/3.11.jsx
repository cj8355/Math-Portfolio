        <p>
        1. Read the problem carefully, making a sketch to organize the given information. Identify the rates that
        are given and the rate that is to be determined.
        2. Write one or more equations that express the basic relationships among the variables.
        3. Introduce rates of change by differentiating the appropriate equations(s) with respect to time t.
        4. Substitute known values and solve for the desired quantity.
        5. Check that units are consistent and the answer is reasonable.
